Learning Some Common Design Patterns in Golang by Trevor Sawler

--> Go is a powerful language for building efficient and scalable applications  
--> as your projects grow, you'll encounter common problems that can be elegantly solved with design patterns.  

##### Design patterns have originated (formally) in a 1994 book by the so-called Gang of Four, entitled Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software  

The book included an overview of 23 patterns written in C++ they do not all translate directly to Go. some, however, are still exceptionally useful in Go  

1. Factory Pattern  
2. Abstract Factory Pattern  
3. Repository Pattern  
4. Singleton Pattern  
5. Builder & Fluent Interface  
6. Adapter Pattern
